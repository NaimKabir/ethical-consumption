# ethical-consumption

`ethical-consumption` is a service for linking consumption with ethical corporate behavior. Consumers should give bad actors less revenue, and should give good actors with good product more revenue.

## Purpose: A Moral Economy

The promise of capitalism remains unfulfilled. Perfect allocation of consumer dollars towards goods and services is meant to reflect social values in our production systems and supply chains, but unethical behavior is rarely punished when we vote with our dollars.

You never know what heinous company is buried deep in the supply chain for your cup of coffee or your tennis shoes, so  you couldn't boycott them even if you wanted to. There is an information barrier that keeps us from bridging the gap between our moral compasses and where our money goes.

We can change that.

As of 2019, [~14% of purchases were made online.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/534123/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-worldwide/) This number is only expected to grow as time goes on. A monitor built directly into browsers that can help us determine moral purchases from immoral ones can help us sleep easierâ€”but with enough of us it will begin to move mountains.
